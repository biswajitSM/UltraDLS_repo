\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.1}{\ignorespaces (Color online) Setup to measure spatially entangled 4-photon states via parametric downconversion in a 2 mm PPKTP crystal. UV pump pulses from a frequency doubled Ti:Sapphire laser are focused by lens L1 ($f_1$~=~250~mm). Photons are collected by the lenses $L2$ ($f_2$~=~270~mm) and detected by the detector assemblies $D1-D3$ that use photon counting APDs to detect single photons in a particular direction defined by the apertures $A$ placed in the combined focal planes of $L2$ and $L3$ ($f_3$~=~4.5~mm). The beamsplitter, $BS$, allows to record if two photons are in the same spatial mode. To this end detector assemblies $D1$ and $D2$ are placed on computer controlled translation stages. Correlations in the coincidence events are due to 4-photon states that are created by the process of stimulated emission of photon pairs.\relax }}{15}{figure.caption.8}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.2}{\ignorespaces (Color online) Measured single count rates $R_2$ (open symbols) and 2-fold coincidence rates $R_{23}$ (filled symbols) as a function of position $x_2$, demonstrating spatial correlations in the two-photon field. The pulsed laser beam was focused in the center of the crystal using a $f$~=~250~mm lens. Data are collected using a 1 nm FWHM bandpass filter and a 1.5~mm aperture in the far-field. The solid and dashed lines indicate Lorentzian and Gaussian fits to the single and coincidence rates, respectively. The inset shows a far field image of the SPDC light emitted by the PPKTP crystal at a temperature of 20~$^\circ $C. The approximate positions of detectors D2 and D3 are shown by circles on the ring.\relax }}{17}{figure.caption.9}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.3}{\ignorespaces (Color) Measured joint spatial distribution of stimulated pair emission. (a) False-color plot of the measured difference in coincidence rate $(R_{21}^{0\mathrm {ns}} - R_{21}^{12\mathrm {ns}})$ as a function of the positions of $x_1$ and $x_2$ of detectors $D_1$ and $D_2$. Data are collected with a 5~nm FWHM bandpass filter and a 1.5~mm aperture size. The observed maximum coincidence rate $(R_{21}^{0\mathrm {ns}}$ is typically 25,000~s$^{-1}$. The data clearly demonstrate that stimulated pair emission occurs when the photons are emitted in the same spatial mode, i.e. when $x_1$~=~$x_2$. (b) Visibility $\chi $ of the 4-photon state as a function of position $x_2$. The different symbols (triangles, circles, squares) correspond to different positions $x_1$ (44.4, 50.0, 55.6~mrad) of detector $D_1$. Data are collected using a 1~nm FWHM bandpass filter and a 1.5 mm aperture. The solid lines through the data are Gaussian fits.\relax }}{20}{figure.caption.10}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.4}{\ignorespaces (Color online) Visibility $\chi $ of the 4-photon state as a function of aperture size using a 1~nm FWHM bandpass filter (triangles) and a 5~nm FWHM bandpass filter (circles). These data are obtained by subtracting the measured coincidence rate at a delay of 12~ns from the measured coincidence rate at zero delay. Typical single count rates on the detector are $1.4\times 10^6$ and $3\times 10^5$ sec$^{-1}$ for apertures $>$ 2 mm and drop to $5\times 10^5$ and $1\times 10^5$ sec$^{-1}$ for a 1 mm aperture size. The solid lines represent a calculation with no free parameters (see text). For apertures larger than 2 mm, the aperture is limited by lens $L3$ and the numerical aperture of the fiber and the visibility saturates as indicated by the horizontal dashed lines. The inset shows the measured coincidence rate $R_{12}$ as a function of electronic delay for a 1~nm FWHM bandpass filter and a 1~mm aperture size ($\chi $~=~0.25), indicated by the arrow.\relax }}{22}{figure.caption.11}
